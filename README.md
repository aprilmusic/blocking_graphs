In Spring 2019, I worked with a group to collect data on blocking group and housing patterns in our Harvard freshman class. We collected data from over 800 students, and through having them list their blockmates and linkmates, as well as scraping publically available databases for information on student dorms, houses, athlete status, etc, were able to account for over 1400 students in our class. Our primary findings were published with the Harvard Open Data Project, where they received significant attention from students and faculty.

In order to create further visualizations with this data, I'm creating this repo!

We guaranteed strict confidentiality for students who filled out the survey. While I have the data locally, I cannot push the data onto a public repo. As such, I'm only publishing my code and images of the resulting graphs.
